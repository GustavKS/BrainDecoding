# Second Lab Rotation: Brain Decoding

Subjects were presented images of a house or a face. In a memory task, they were asked to remember a certain face or house while they were being recorded with MEG. This project aims to decode the MEG data to retrieve the remembered image category.



#### Subjects:

* S1: ValueError: You have 1 events shorter than the shortest_event. These are very unusual and you may want to set min_duration to a larger value e.g. x / raw.info['sfreq']. Where x = 1 sample shorter than the shortest event length.
* S2: OK
* S3: Night 3 missing file: **OSError**: Standard file **\.res4 not found
* S4: OK, but nights 1, 3, 4, 5
* S5: OK, but nights 1, 3, 4, 5
* S6: OK, but Night 2: **ValueError**: No matching events found for maint_FACE (event id 43) (one weird file in the directory) (fixed by defining that first character is number)
* S7: OK
* S8: Night 4 data is missing and night 2: **ValueError**: Missing channels from ch_names required by include: ['UDIO001']
* S9: no data.
* S10: OK
* S11: OK
* S12: night 4: **ValueError**: You have 1 events shorter than the shortest_event. These are very unusual and you may want to set min_duration to a larger value e.g. x / raw.info['sfreq']. Where x = 1 sample shorter than the shortest event length.
